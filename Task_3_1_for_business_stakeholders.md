## Key Findings

| Metric                        | What happened in the test group (A)?                | What it means for the business                        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **DAU (Daily Active Users)** | Significantly decreased                             | Negative signal — fewer players are logging in         |
| **D7 Retention**             | Stayed about the same overall                       | Retention of existing players did not improve — most return at the same rate. However, new players (who never saw the old version) retained worse. |
| **Battles per Player**       | Players in the test group play more battles         | Those who stay are more engaged                          |
| **Damage, kills, time in battle** | Remained nearly the same                      | Core gameplay performance was not affected              |

## What This Means

- The new version of the game drives away some users — fewer people log in daily.
- Retention for existing players stayed the same.  
  However, retention for new players dropped, which may indicate onboarding or early gameplay issues.
- Players who continue to play are more active, likely because they are the most loyal or engaged users to begin with.

Bottom line: the changes make the game less attractive to a broad audience, even if they increase engagement for a small group of loyal users.

## Possible Reasons

- The first-time experience may be too complex or confusing.
- Changes may have made it harder to understand or enjoy the game quickly.
- The game now appeals more to hardcore players, but loses the general audience.

---

## Recommendations

1. Do not release this version widely — it reduces the overall player base.
2. Run additional analysis of the first play session — where do new users drop off?
3. Conduct user interviews or UX tests to uncover pain points and frustrations.
4. Build a new iteration:
   - Focus on making the early experience smoother and more intuitive.
   - Keep the elements that drive deeper engagement for committed players.

## Conclusion

The test shows that the current version is not suitable for full rollout. It should be refined with a focus on retaining new users while preserving what makes the game engaging for loyal players.
